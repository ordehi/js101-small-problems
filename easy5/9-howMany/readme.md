# How Many

## Problem Statement

Write a function that counts the number of occurrences of each element in a given array. Once counted, log each element alongside the number of occurrences. Consider the words case sensitive e.g. ("suv" !== "SUV").

Example:

```js
let vehicles = [
  'car',
  'car',
  'truck',
  'car',
  'SUV',
  'truck',
  'motorcycle',
  'motorcycle',
  'car',
  'truck',
];

countOccurrences(vehicles);

// console output -- your output sequence may be different
// car => 4;
// truck => 3;
// SUV => 1;
// motorcycle => 2;
```
