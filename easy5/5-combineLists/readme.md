# Combine Two Lists

## Problem Statement

Write a function that combines two arrays passed as arguments, and returns a new array that contains all elements from both array arguments, with each element taken in alternation.

You may assume that both input arrays are non-empty, and that they have the same number of elements.

Example:

```js
interleave([1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']); // [1, "a", 2, "b", 3, "c"]
```
