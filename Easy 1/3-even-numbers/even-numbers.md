## Problem statement

Log all even numbers from `1` to `99`, inclusive, to the console, with each number on a separate line.

## Expected Input and Output

### Input:

n/a

### Output:

Log even numbers from 1 to 99 to the console as separate lines

## Explicit Requirements

A loop must iterate from 0 to 99 inclusive, log the value of a counter at each iteration if counter is even

## Implicit Requirements

The loop must have a stop clause
Start the loop at 2
Increase the value of the loop counter by 2 so you only iterate through even numbers

## Mental Model

Loop from 1 to 99 by adding 2 to the counter at each iteration and logging each value to the console

## Algorithm

1. Loop counter starts at 2
2. While loop counter is less than or equal to 99, log loop counter value to console
3. Add 2 to loop counter

## Further Exploration

Repeat this exercise with a technique different from the one that you used, and different from the one provided. Also consider adding a way for the user to specify the limits of the odd numbers logged to the console.
